# parallel-programming
## Why we need parallel programming?
To speed up the program. Save time - save money.<br />
> ## **In this project i focus on parallel programming on GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).**
## CPU vs GPU ?
### **CPU**
- There are serveral cores, each core strong and complex.
- Focus on optimizing the time to complete the job (latency).
### **GPU**
- There are many cores, each core weak and simple.
- Focus on optimizing the amount of work completed in an unit of time (throughput).
